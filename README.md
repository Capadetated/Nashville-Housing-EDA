# Nashville-Housing-EDA

A Exploratory Data Analysis of Nashville Housing Data was performed.

This was an IBM Cognos-based project using 5 types of graphs to give insights to the Nashville Housing market based on the 2013-2016 data. The report demonstrated it was a seller's market over those years, the strongest drivers of home price included area, acreage, and bed/bath count, and that Summer is the best time to buy.

"Assignment2_Fitch.doc" contains the text of the analysis along with the supporting figures and tables. "Nashville_housing_data_2013.csv" contains the dataset only for 2013 (the other data was truncated since the file was too large - it can be requested as needed).
